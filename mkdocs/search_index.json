We have performed this procedure countless times, for example when we add some sugar to a cup of hot tea. To find the concentration, we need to know how much solvent (usually in grams) is dissolved in how much solvent (usually measured in liters).\n\n\nDilution of stock solutions\n\n\nCommonly, we will create high-concentration solutions in the lab that can later be diluted. A high-concentration solution is called a 'stock' solution. Making a stock solution allows us to save space. For example, if we have a solution that has 100g of salt in 1L of water, we need a liter-sized bottle to store it. However, if we dissolve 100g of salt in 0.1L of water, we can store the same amount of solution in 1/10th the space.\n\n\nQuestion How does using a stock solution (vs. making a new solution every time it is needed) make science more reproducible?\n\n\nTo dilute a solution from the original concentration to a new concentration we need to keep track of several things:\n\n\n\n\nThe original concentration of the solution\n\n\nThe desired final amount (volume) of the dilution we are making\n\n\nDesired final concentration of the dilution we are making\n\n\n\n\nThe thing we need to figure out is what amount (volume) of the concentrated stock solution do we need to add to more solvent to make a more dilute solution.\n\n\nAgain, keep in mind that this is an 'everyday' problem. Imagine you made some soup and accidentally added too much salt. You can't take the salt out, but you can add more water to make the final concentration of the salt less.\n\n\nThe formula for calculating dilutions is:\n\n\nC\n1\nV\n1\n = C\n2\nV\n2\n\n\nWhere:\n\n\n\n\nC\n1\n = The original/starting concentration of the stock solution\n\n\nV\n1\n = The (unknown) amount (volume) of the stock solution you will\n  need to use\n\n\nC\n2\n = The final, desired concentration\n\n\nV\n2\n = The final, desired volume you wish to make\n\n\n\n\nMoles\n\n\nProbably one of the most important concepts in chemistry is the concept of a mole). The mole is a special number (it even has its own holiday). A mole is just a number, but a very large one:\n\n\n6.02214078\u00d710\n23\n (A mole: also known as, Avagadro's Number)\n\n\nA 'mole' is actually shorthand for that large number. Just like a 'dozen' = 12, a couple = 2, etc.\n\n\nSo why do we need this number?\n\n\nWell, Atoms are very small. We can't count them one by one, but when we have lots of atoms (several grams at least for the kinds of scales we have at school), we can measure and estimate how many atoms we have.\n\n\nWeighing atoms\n\n\nBy definition, when we have a mole of atoms, we have 6.02214078\u00d710\n23\n atoms. In reality, just like not every egg will weigh 73g, different atoms have a diffent atomic mass. On the periodic table, the atomic mass is the number below the element symbol:\nFor carbon (C), 12.011g of carbon, we have 6.02214078\u00d710\n23\n carbon atoms. A 1.008g sample of hydrogen (H) weighs much less but has the same number of atoms.\nWhy this is very important\n\n\nWith an understanding of Avagradro's number and the atomic masses from the periodic table, we can accomplish something amazing. When we combine elements to form a new compound (e.g. combining hydrogen and oxygen to make water), we know exactly how much (mass) of hydrogen we need to combine with how much oxygen so that we have enough amounts of each.\n\n\nMolar mass/moluar mass/fomula weight\n\n\nWhen we have a compound such as Glucose (C\n6\nH\n12\nO\n6\n) we calculate the molar mass as the sum of the total number of moles of each atom in the compound.\n\n\nC\n6\nH\n12\nO\n6\n\n\n6 Moles of Carbon 12 Moles of Hydrogen 6 Moles of Oxygen\n\n\nMolarity\n\n\nRelated to moles is the concept of molarity, or how many moles of a substance do we have in a solution. The formula for molarity of is:\n\n\nMoles of solute/ Liters of solvent\n\n\nLimiting reagents\n\n\nConceptually, knowing how many moles we have allows us to determine in advance how many moles of a substance is needed to create a particular molecule. For example: C\n6\nH\n12\nO\n6\n Would require us to have 6 moles of Carbon, 6 moles of Oxygen, and 12 moles of Hydrogen\n\n\nWhile we won't solve an example here, the sandwich example below gets the point across about limiting reagents - we can only make a much of a substance as the least abundant component will allow; If we have hundreds of slices of cheese, but only 2 slices of bread, we get only one sandwich.\n\n\nLinks\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a mole\n - A nice intro to the mole.\n\n\nDilution Problems, Chemistry, Molarity \n Concentration Examples, Formula \n Equations\n - Although some slightly different notation is used, this is a thorough intro to dilutions.",

Philosophy is nearly endless in its pursuit of\nquestions, and questions of the form \"what is X?\" lead to entire fields of\nphilosophical study (e.g. \"what is beauty\" is the subject of aesthetics; \"what\nis a part and what is a whole?\" is the subject of mereology).\n\n\nPhilosophy tries to help us be clear about words and their meaning, and what\nwe mean when we use those words.\n\n\nTo get quickly to the practical, how do we benefit from the work philosophy\ndoes? Here are four questions philosophy has worked on and that we can learn\nfrom:\n\n\nPhilosophy asks\n\n\nWhat is knowledge?\n\n\nEpistemology\n- \u03b5\u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1\n*\n\nis a branch of philosophy that asks the question how can we know something?\nWhat is evidence for/against something? How and when should we trust (or refuse\nto trust) evidence? When do we have enough evidence? These are very important\nquestions in the sciences.\n\n\nWhat is logical?\n\n\nLogic - \u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\n is a branch of philosophy\nwhich asks about what are the rules of reason and reasoning. Given some premise\n(e.g. Socrates is a man, men are mortal) how do we reach a conclusion (e.g.\nSocrates is a man, therefore he is mortal) that is true? Logic also gives rise\nto mathematics which underlies the natural sciences (although math is \nnot\n a\nscience).\n\n\nHow do we communicate our meaning?\n\n\nPhilosophy of language\n\nasks how do we use words (or signs; see semantics \n\u03c3\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2\n) to represent abstract concepts? In the\nEnglish language for example, I can \"\nknow\n that I have 3 dollars in my\npocket\" and I can \"\nknow\n how my friend thinks.\" Spanish, like other Romance\nlanguages distinguishes between knowing a fact (verb: saber) from knowing\nsomeone you have relationship with (verb: conocer).\n\n\nUltimately, to operate in science we need to weigh evidence, develop logical\nconclusions, and express our meaning. These approaches are not inherently\nscientific, but they are used by science.\n\nPhilosophy of science\n is\nconcerned with a more thorough exploration of what the role of philosophy is in\nthe sciences.\n\n\n\n\nTake home message\n: Science makes use of philosophical tools (methods) to do\nits work. At some point, you should get to know a bit about that subject.\n\n\n\n\n*\nNote\n: Although here and in many cases philosophy makes use of\nGreek terms this is not meant to privilege Greek or Western thought. Every\nhuman culture has its own ways of thinking and reasoning and it is arrogant to\nsuggest that the most popular (or best documented) approach is necessarily the\nbest one. It is also arrogant to imagine that Greek philosophy did not have its\nantecedents in other cultures. The use of the Greek terms above is to draw\nattention both to the important contributions of the Greek scholars and to\nacknowledge that if we ignore their specific origin we risk imagining that these\nare the only possible ways to think about these terms.\n\n\nKey questions\n\n\nAfter that detour through philosophy, how do we bring those ideas back to\nscience? Well, to do science we need to have a working definition so let's\nreturn to the one suggested above:\n\n\n\n\nThe \nScientific Method\n is the idea that \nquestions about the natural\n world\ncan by answered by \nfollowing some set of steps\n to \nacquire knowledge\n\nabout the world and \nexplain that knowledge\n in the form of a \nhypothesis\n.\n\n\n\n\nUsing this definition, and the one you posed in the \nWhat do you know\n\nquestions, here are some additional ones to ask.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes the scientific method resemble how we ask questions about the world in\n   in ways that aren't traditionally considered science? For example, is a\n   criminal investigation scientific? Is the exploration of a theme in the\n   Beethoven's Diabelli variations (Op. 120) scientific? Is a model volcano\n   presented at a science fair scientific?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the \"natural world\"?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBesides the scientific method, what other methods do you think we might see\n   used in science?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActivity\n\n\nShort essay\n\n\n\n\nAbout short essay assignments\n\n\nShort essay assignments are typed, 500 words maximum or less.

Chalmers\n\n\n\n\nAmazon link\n\n\nAmazon Summary: Since its first publication in 1976, Alan Chalmers's highly\n  regarded and widely read work--translated into eighteen languages--has become\n  a classic introduction to the scientific method, known for its accessibility\n  to beginners and its value as a resource for advanced students and scholars.\n\n\n\n\nDefending Science - within reason\n - Susan Haack\n\n\n\n\nAmazon link\n\n\nAmazon Summary: Sweeping in scope, penetrating in analysis, and generously\n  illustrated with examples from the history of science, this new and original\n  approach to familiar questions about scientific evidence and method tackles\n  vital questions about science and its place in society. Avoiding the twin\n  pitfalls of scientism and cynicism, noted philosopher Susan Haack argues that,\n  fallible and flawed as they are, the natural sciences have been among the most\n  successful of human enterprises-valuable not only for the vast, interlocking\n  body of knowledge they have discovered, and not only for the technological\n  advances that have improved our lives, but as a manifestation of the human\n  talent for inquiry at its imperfect but sometimes remarkable best. This\n  wide-ranging, trenchant, and illuminating book explores the complexities of\n  scientific evidence, and the multifarious ways in which the sciences have\n  refined and amplified the methods of everyday empirical inquiry; articulates\n  the ways in which the social sciences are like the natural sciences, and the\n  ways in which they are different; disentangles the confusions of radical\n  rhetoricians and cynical sociologists of science; exposes the evasions of\n  apologists for religious resistance to scientific advances; weighs the\n  benefits and the dangers of technology; tracks the efforts of the legal system\n  to make the best use of scientific testimony; and tackles predictions of the\n  eventual culmination, or annihilation, of the scientific enterprise.Writing\n  with verve and wry humor, in a witty, direct, and accessible style, Haack\n  takes readers beyond the \"Science Wars\" to a balanced understanding of the\n  value, and the limitations, of the scientific enterprise.",
