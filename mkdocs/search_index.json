It is \nnot\n science,\nbut for centuries it has engaged one specific activity and asked two important\nquestions that scientists would do well not to ignore\n\n\nPhilosophy does\n\n\nConcept Clarification\n: One of the works of philosophy is to clarify what\nwe mean when we say something. Take the phrase \"it's a beautiful day.\" What is\nbeauty? What is the day? Philosophy is nearly endless in its pursuit of\nquestions, and questions of the form \"what is X?\" lead to entire field of\nphilosophical study (e.g. what is beauty, is the subject of aesthetics).\n\n\nPhilosophy tries to help us be clear about words and their meaning, and what\nwe mean when we use those words.\n\n\nTo get quickly to the practical, how do we benefit from the work philosophy\ndoes? Here are four questions philosophy has worked on and that we can borrow:\n\n\nPhilosophy asks\n\n\nWhat is knowledge?\n\n\nEpistemology\n- \u03b5\u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1\n*\n\nis a branch of philosophy that asks question how can we know something? What is\nevidence for/against something? How and when should we trust (or refuse to\ntrust)evidence? When do we have enough evidence? These are very important\nquestions in the sciences.\n\n\nWhat is logical?\n\n\nLogic - \u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\n is a branch of philosophy\nwhich asks about what are the rules of reason and reasoning. Given some premise\n(e.g. Socrates is a man, men are mortal) how do we reach a conclusion (e.g.\nSocrates is a man, therefore he is mortal) that is true? Logic also gives rise\nto mathematics which underlies the natural sciences (although math is \nnot\n a\nscience).\n\n\nHow do we communicate our meaning?\n\n\nPhilosophy of language\n\nasks how do we use words\n(or signs; see semantics \n\u03c3\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2\n)\nto represent abstract concepts? In the English language for example, I can\n\"\nknow\n that I have 3 dollars in my pocket\" and I can \"\nknow\n how my friend\nthinks.\" Spanish, like other Romance languages distinguishes between knowing\na fact (verb: saber) from knowing someone you have relationship with (verb:\nconocer).\n\n\nUltimately, to operate in science we need to weigh evidence, develop logical\nconclusions, and express our meaning. These approaches are not inherently\nscientific, but they are used by science.\n\nPhilosophy of science\n is\nconcerned with a more thorough exploration of what the role of philosophy is in\nthe sciences.\n\n\n\n\nTake home message\n: Science makes use of philosophical tools to do its work.\nAt some point, you should get to know a bit about that subject.\n\n\n\n\n*\nNote\n: Although here and in many cases philosophy makes use of\nGreek terms this is not meant to privilege them, or Western thought. Every\nhuman culture has its own ways of thinking and reasoning and it is arrogant to\nsuggest that the most popular (or best documented) approach is necessarily the\nbest one. It is also arrogant to imagine that Greek philosophy did not have its\nantecedents in other cultures. The use of the Greek terms above is to draw\nattention both to the important contributions of the Greek scholars and to\nacknowledge that if we ignore their specific origin we risk imagining that these\nare the only possible ways to think about these terms.\n\n\nKey questions\n\n\nAfter that detour through philosophy, how do we bring those ideas back to\nscience? Well, to do science we need to have a working definition so let's\nreturn to the one suggested above:\n\n\n\n\nThe \nScientific Method\n is the idea that \nquestions about the natural\n world\ncan by answered by \nfollowing some set of steps\n to \nacquire knowledge\n\nabout the world and \nexplain that knowledge\n in the form of a \nhypothesis\n.\n\n\n\n\nUsing this definition, and the one you posed in the \nWhat do you know\n\nquestions, here are some additional ones to ask.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes the scientific method resemble how we ask questions about the world in\n   in ways that aren't traditionally considered science? For example, is a\n   criminal investigation scientific? Is the exploration of a theme in the\n   Beethoven's Diabelli variations (Op. 120) scientific? Is a model volcano\n   presented at a science fair scientific?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the \"natural world\"?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActivity\n\n\nShort essay\n\n\n\n\nAbout short essay assignments\n\n\nShort essay assignments are typed, 500 words maximum or less. In addition to\n  getting to know your thoughts they are also a chance to get feedback on\n  your writing. You will usually have a minimum of two weeks to complete these\n  assignments. It is highly suggested that you give yourself time to write a\n  first draft, get feedback, and write a final draft.\n\n\n\n\nWrite a short essay on the following topic:\n\n\nThe scientific method is a unique form of inquiry\n\n\nThink about breaking up this essay into 3 sections\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to the scientific method\n\n\nA body where you contrast the scientific method with one or more other forms\n  of inquiry (for example, how does the scientific method compare to how a\n  fiction author explores a character in a novel).\n\n\nA conclusion where you summarize your thoughts\n\n\n\n\nThis is something more of an English assignment rather than a scientific writing\nassignment. You may have any opinion or position you want, but develop your\nideas clearly and keep your writing simple.\n\n\nReadings and resources\n\n\nThere are a number of books, articles, links, etc. that could contribute to this\ntopic. These resources are not meant to be exhaustive or suggest you should\nreview all of these materials. If this topic piques your curiosity, have a look.\nPlease also suggest other resources that you find and I will add to this list.\n\n\nBooks\n\n\nWhat Is This Thing Called Science?\n - Alan F. Chalmers\n\n\n\n\nAmazon link\n\n\nAmazon Summary: Since its first publication in 1976, Alan Chalmers's highly\n  regarded and widely read work--translated into eighteen languages--has become\n  a classic introduction to the scientific method, known for its accessibility\n  to beginners and its value as a resource for advanced students and scholars.\n\n\n\n\nDefending Science - within reason\n - Susan Haack\n\n\n\n\nAmazon link\n\n\nAmazon Summary: Sweeping in scope, penetrating in analysis, and generously\n  illustrated with examples from the history of science, this new and original\n  approach to familiar questions about scientific evidence and method tackles\n  vital questions about science and its place in society. Avoiding the twin\n  pitfalls of scientism and cynicism, noted philosopher Susan Haack argues that,\n  fallible and flawed as they are, the natural sciences have been among the most\n  successful of human enterprises-valuable not only for the vast, interlocking\n  body of knowledge they have discovered, and not only for the technological\n  advances that have improved our lives, but as a manifestation of the human\n  talent for inquiry at its imperfect but sometimes remarkable best. This\n  wide-ranging, trenchant, and illuminating book explores the complexities of\n  scientific evidence, and the multifarious ways in which the sciences have\n  refined and amplified the methods of everyday empirical inquiry; articulates\n  the ways in which the social sciences are like the natural sciences, and the\n  ways in which they are different; disentangles the confusions of radical\n  rhetoricians and cynical sociologists of science; exposes the evasions of\n  apologists for religious resistance to scientific advances; weighs the\n  benefits and the dangers of technology; tracks the efforts of the legal system\n  to make the best use of scientific testimony; and tackles predictions of the\n  eventual culmination, or annihilation, of the scientific enterprise.Writing\n  with verve and wry humor, in a witty, direct, and accessible style, Haack\n  takes readers beyond the \"Science Wars\" to a balanced understanding of the\n  value, and the limitations, of the scientific enterprise.",

What is logical?  Logic - \u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae  is a branch of philosophy\nwhich asks about what are the rules of reason and reasoning. Given some premise\n(e.g. Socrates is a man, men are mortal) how do we reach a conclusion (e.g.\nSocrates is a man, therefore he is mortal) that is true? Logic also gives rise\nto mathematics which underlies the natural sciences (although math is  not  a\nscience).  How do we communicate our meaning?  Philosophy of language \nasks how do we use words\n(or signs; see semantics  \u03c3\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 )\nto represent abstract concepts? In the English language for example, I can\n\" know  that I have 3 dollars in my pocket\" and I can \" know  how my friend\nthinks.\" Spanish, like other Romance languages distinguishes between knowing\na fact (verb: saber) from knowing someone you have relationship with (verb:\nconocer).  Ultimately, to operate in science we need to weigh evidence, develop logical\nconclusions, and express our meaning. These approaches are not inherently\nscientific, but they are used by science. Philosophy of science  is\nconcerned with a more thorough exploration of what the role of philosophy is in\nthe sciences.   Take home message : Science makes use of philosophical tools to do its work.\nAt some point, you should get to know a bit about that subject.   * Note : Although here and in many cases philosophy makes use of\nGreek terms this is not meant to privilege them, or Western thought. Every\nhuman culture has its own ways of thinking and reasoning and it is arrogant to\nsuggest that the most popular (or best documented) approach is necessarily the\nbest one. It is also arrogant to imagine that Greek philosophy did not have its\nantecedents in other cultures. The use of the Greek terms above is to draw\nattention both to the important contributions of the Greek scholars and to\nacknowledge that if we ignore their specific origin we risk imagining that these\nare the only possible ways to think about these terms.",

Well, to do science we need to have a working definition so let's\nreturn to the one suggested above:   The  Scientific Method  is the idea that  questions about the natural  world\ncan by answered by  following some set of steps  to  acquire knowledge \nabout the world and  explain that knowledge  in the form of a  hypothesis .   Using this definition, and the one you posed in the  What do you know \nquestions, here are some additional ones to ask.    Does the scientific method resemble how we ask questions about the world in\n   in ways that aren't traditionally considered science? For example, is a\n   criminal investigation scientific? Is the exploration of a theme in the\n   Beethoven's Diabelli variations (Op. 120) scientific? Is a model volcano\n   presented at a science fair scientific?    What is the \"natural world\"?",

Chalmers   Amazon link  Amazon Summary: Since its first publication in 1976, Alan Chalmers's highly\n  regarded and widely read work--translated into eighteen languages--has become\n  a classic introduction to the scientific method, known for its accessibility\n  to beginners and its value as a resource for advanced students and scholars.   Defending Science - within reason  - Susan Haack   Amazon link  Amazon Summary: Sweeping in scope, penetrating in analysis, and generously\n  illustrated with examples from the history of science, this new and original\n  approach to familiar questions about scientific evidence and method tackles\n  vital questions about science and its place in society. Avoiding the twin\n  pitfalls of scientism and cynicism, noted philosopher Susan Haack argues that,\n  fallible and flawed as they are, the natural sciences have been among the most\n  successful of human enterprises-valuable not only for the vast, interlocking\n  body of knowledge they have discovered, and not only for the technological\n  advances that have improved our lives, but as a manifestation of the human\n  talent for inquiry at its imperfect but sometimes remarkable best. This\n  wide-ranging, trenchant, and illuminating book explores the complexities of\n  scientific evidence, and the multifarious ways in which the sciences have\n  refined and amplified the methods of everyday empirical inquiry; articulates\n  the ways in which the social sciences are like the natural sciences, and the\n  ways in which they are different; disentangles the confusions of radical\n  rhetoricians and cynical sociologists of science; exposes the evasions of\n  apologists for religious resistance to scientific advances; weighs the\n  benefits and the dangers of technology; tracks the efforts of the legal system\n  to make the best use of scientific testimony; and tackles predictions of the\n  eventual culmination, or annihilation, of the scientific enterprise.Writing\n  with verve and wry humor, in a witty, direct, and accessible style, Haack\n  takes readers beyond the \"Science Wars\" to a balanced understanding of the\n  value, and the limitations, of the scientific enterprise.",
