            "text": "Writing Corner\n\n\nScientists are writers\n\n\nWriting is the one thing you will never see a scientist doing on film or TV.\n\nIn reality, the more senior a scientist you are the less time you spend doing\nexperiments and the more time you spend writing.\n\n\nWhy is writing essential for scientists? Your entire career depends upon:\n\n\n\n\nYour ability to clearly communicate your research results\n\n\nYour ability to convince prospective employers your work is important\n\n\nYour ability to convince those who fund your work (sometimes your employer,\n  but more often government agencies and philanthropic foundations) that they should pay for your work to be done\n\n\n\n\nThere are other reasons to be a good writer, but if you fail in the three areas above, your career will end before it starts.\n\n\nYou've been misled\n\n\nIn your life as a student, you have almost certainly been misled\nabout writing. This has not been done purposely but as a symptom of standard\neducation. By high school you have already done a fair amount of writing. By\ncollege graduation you may have written more essays than you will ever do later\nin life (unless you become a writer, or a scientist). Where does deception fit\nin?\n\n\nFor most of your life as a writer, people (your teachers) have been paid to\nread your writing.\n\n\nThat circumstance is opposite to how the real world works - unless you\nbecome a novelist and are successful enough that people pay you to read your\nwriting.\n\n\nYour beautiful lab reports, flowing essays, and personal stories are usually\nread by people whose job depends on reading your work (see the video link at\nthe end on the craft of writing effectively to which I credit this insight).\nEven if your writing is poor, your teachers will still read it and hopefully\ngive you useful feedback. Why does this make \nyou\n a victim?\n\n\nWhen people are judging you by your writing, and when they have the option to\nstop reading your writing they are in a far different position than your\nteachers.\n\n\nIf your writing is confusing, redundant, hard to follow, etc. your readers will simply stop reading\n\n\nHaving your writing discarded is devastating if your reader is a college\nadmission officer, an employer, or a science funding agency. It's also\nsomething to remember when you are given instructions for an assignment (e.g. a\nformat, font, word limit you are asked to follow). If you violate those rules\nyou can usually guarantee it will be counted against you (I can't tell you how\nmany time students have asked if they can exceed a word limit - don't!). These\ninstructions are usually given by people who need to review 10's - 100's of\nessays/applications/etc. and they are looking for ways to reduce their workload\n(not to mention maintain impartiality and fairness towards those who did follow\nthe rules).\n\n\nDon't be ashamed or feel insecure if your writing skills are poor at the moment.\nWriting is a skill, and can be learned and improved by practice.\n\n\nPracticing this skill is worth it. Good writing enables a scientist to succeed.\nEven if you don't plan on being a scientist, this advice will benefit you.\n\n\nHow to become a good writer\n\n\nThe best advice: the more you write, read other's writing, and\n(importantly) edit writing, the more natural good writing will be for you.\nGood writing skills are a long-term self-improvement project that's never too\nlate to begin.   \n\n\nI'll admit up front that this article cannot make you into a good writer. While\nyou still need to get to that destination, no single step will take you there.\nInstead, I have assembled a few resources to help. I have also taken a\nperspective, the one taken by the book \nThe Longman Guide to Revising Prose\n - we will\nfocus on good editing skills rather than writing.\n\n\nWhy focus on editing?\n\n\nI'll answer in two quotes (I hope the sources correct, but the ideas are valid)\n\n\n\n\n\"All writing is rewriting\" - John Green, Author\n\n\n\"I would have written a shorter letter, but I did not have the time.\"\n   Blaise Pascal, Philosopher/Mathematician\n\n\n\n\nYou are smart, creative, and original. But like most human beings, it's more\nthan likely that what you first write on the page is not the clearest\nexpression of what you want to communicate.\n\n\nIt is said that we often judge ourselves by our intentions and others by their\nactions. What that aphorism means in relation to writing is that we usually\nknow what we mean to say when we write something down. What we have actually\nsaid is what our readers may interpret - which is usually full of differences\nwe didn't expect.\n\n\nAlthough gap between author and reader  sounds like a recipe for frustration,\nthere are some easy ways to overcome most of the problems caused by this\ndilemma. The first and easiest solution is to \nput distance between yourself\nand your writing.\n\n\nHave you ever read something you wrote a few days or weeks ago and found things\nthat were unclear or errors of some sort? By reading your writing after some\ntime has past, you become a more objective reader, and can often find and fix\nmistakes. This is the best argument for making sure that you give yourself\nas much time as possible for writing assignments. \nWork out how much time\n(including days away from writing) needed to write a first, second, and perhaps\neven a third draft. Rushed, last-minute writing will almost certainly cost\nyou.\n\n\nAs you become a better writer you will also become a better editor of your own\nwriting. The next thing suggestion for editing is to \nfollow a method\n. The\nmethod suggested below will not correct every type of writing difficulty, but provides clear guidelines for revising writing.\n\n\nParamedic Method\n\n\nBelow are a handout and video that explains this method (which is detailed and\nelaborated on in the above mentioned Longman Guide book). I will not ask you\nmemorize this method or demand that you always use it. I do hope that if you\ntake a little time to understand it, you will apply in revision assignment\nbelow.\n\n\nThis method has a few versions and I'll list a few steps at its core:\n\n\n\n\nCircle/highlight prepositions (of, in, to, etc.) - You will be looking to reduce or eliminate prepositions.\n\n\nCircle the \"is\" forms of verbs (where possible you will want to eliminate the verb to be)\n\n\nCircle the action (you will want to replace \"is/to be\" verbs with action verbs)\n\n\nSimplify actions and avoid compound verbs\n\n\nStart sentences fast - get to the point and avoid filler\n\n\nRead the writing aloud with feeling and correct sentences that sound awkward\n\n\n\n\nThese 6 rules may sound a bit intimidating, but as I said you don't have to memorize them. Instead, watch this video that explains how this method works:\n\n\n\n\nThe Paramedic Method\n  [17 minutes]\n\n\nParamedic method handout - this is unrelated to the specific video but has some nice examples\n\n\n\n\nThis method is a first step to writing clear sentences. Besides clear sentence\nstructure you must also think about how you develop logical arguments and how\nyour voice makes it easy for the reader to understand your meaning. These edits\ngo beyond sentence structure and we can cover them in a future assignment.\n\n\nThe final step of improving writing is to actually have someone else read your\nwriting. A good editor should return to you a document covered in red\nink. Your obligation is put aside any pride and getting upset.

By high school you have already done a fair amount of writing. By\ncollege graduation you may have written more essays than you will ever do later\nin life (unless you become a writer, or a scientist). Where does deception fit\nin?  For most of your life as a writer, people (your teachers) have been paid to\nread your writing.  That circumstance is opposite to how the real world works - unless you\nbecome a novelist and are successful enough that people pay you to read your\nwriting.  Your beautiful lab reports, flowing essays, and personal stories are usually\nread by people whose job depends on reading your work (see the video link at\nthe end on the craft of writing effectively to which I credit this insight).\nEven if your writing is poor, your teachers will still read it and hopefully\ngive you useful feedback. Why does this make  you  a victim?  When people are judging you by your writing, and when they have the option to\nstop reading your writing they are in a far different position than your\nteachers.  If your writing is confusing, redundant, hard to follow, etc. your readers will simply stop reading  Having your writing discarded is devastating if your reader is a college\nadmission officer, an employer, or a science funding agency. It's also\nsomething to remember when you are given instructions for an assignment (e.g. a\nformat, font, word limit you are asked to follow). If you violate those rules\nyou can usually guarantee it will be counted against you (I can't tell you how\nmany time students have asked if they can exceed a word limit - don't!).

But like most human beings, it's more\nthan likely that what you first write on the page is not the clearest\nexpression of what you want to communicate.  It is said that we often judge ourselves by our intentions and others by their\nactions. What that aphorism means in relation to writing is that we usually\nknow what we mean to say when we write something down. What we have actually\nsaid is what our readers may interpret - which is usually full of differences\nwe didn't expect.  Although gap between author and reader  sounds like a recipe for frustration,\nthere are some easy ways to overcome most of the problems caused by this\ndilemma. The first and easiest solution is to  put distance between yourself\nand your writing.  Have you ever read something you wrote a few days or weeks ago and found things\nthat were unclear or errors of some sort? By reading your writing after some\ntime has past, you become a more objective reader, and can often find and fix\nmistakes. This is the best argument for making sure that you give yourself\nas much time as possible for writing assignments.  Work out how much time\n(including days away from writing) needed to write a first, second, and perhaps\neven a third draft. Rushed, last-minute writing will almost certainly cost\nyou.  As you become a better writer you will also become a better editor of your own\nwriting. The next thing suggestion for editing is to  follow a method .

Circle the \"is\" forms of verbs (where possible you will want to eliminate the verb to be)  Circle the action (you will want to replace \"is/to be\" verbs with action verbs)  Simplify actions and avoid compound verbs  Start sentences fast - get to the point and avoid filler  Read the writing aloud with feeling and correct sentences that sound awkward   These 6 rules may sound a bit intimidating, but as I said you don't have to memorize them.

After perhaps years of work a scientist (actually almost a group of scientists) will write a paper (often called a manuscript) detailing their work.\n\n\nPurpose of the paper \u2013 adding pieces to the puzzle\n\n\nThe purpose of the paper is to communicate the new contribution the scientists\u2019 work represented. In very rare occasions, that contribution is something new and unexpected (i.e., an entirely new phenomenon). For example, see \nthis article and the original paper\n on the discovery of that the universe was not static, but expanding.\n\n\nMore often, scientists answer smaller questions or pieces of questions. Think about science more as discovering an image as you slowly add puzzle pieces, rather than discovering an image by turning a corner in a museum \u201cand there it is!\u201d\n\n\nWhat this means is that amongst a group of scientists (usually called a field or discipline, for example \u201ccancer biologists\u201d) there are a variety of related questions big and small. For example, if we asked a school to figure out how cars work (no Wikipedia or Google), we might investigate how engines work, how transmissions work, how gasoline works, how wheels work, etc. There is one big question (how cars work) but the way to answer that is usually by figuring out how individual components work and trying to put that knowledge together. This approach is called reductionism (reducing a large problem to the sum of its parts). It is not the only approach, and does not always work, but that is another conversation.\n\n\nWhen you write your paper, you are announcing you have found a new and important puzzle piece! But there are problems. Scientific questions usually come from a really big puzzle. Suppose in your section of the puzzle you have found a starfish. Maybe the puzzle is a beach scene? But what if someone else\u2019s puzzle pieces are shaping into a snowy mountain? They might not believe you are interpreting things correctly. You may think the same - maybe their section will turn out to be a cloud? You will not only need to put some context to your work (i.e., we have other pieces that look like sand and water), but you will need to prove you are qualified to tell what starfishes look like (i.e., you have a marine biology degree). You will need to show you are both working on the same puzzle and your pieces belong to the same image. Before we get too lost in analogy, let\u2019s come back to the main sections of a paper and see what they do for us.\n\n\nPaper Sections \u2013 demonstrating your puzzle piece fits and is important\n\n\nTypically, a paper will present the following sections. Here is what they are and do:\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nThis is usually a very short summary of the main findings of your work. We aren\u2019t writing a mystery novel where we want to build up to our new and important findings. Instead, we clearly state the main question we are working on and what we have found. The purpose here is to help the reader decide if the paper will be interesting to them (i.e., that it addresses a question they are working on, or is related to questions they work on).  \n\n\nExample paper: \u201cIn this paper we describe the discovery of several puzzle pieces which suggest a starfish is located in grid A7 of puzzle 124.\u201d \u2013 A reader also working in or near that grid might want to know if they will find similar images, or if maybe combining their data with yours will make a clearer picture. Other readers working further away might wonder if this means the overall scene might turn out to be a beach. Readers working on puzzle 125 might not decide to read this paper.\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\nUsually, three things are accomplished in this section:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatement of importance\n: You will state something about the general importance of the scientific questions you are working on. For example, \u201cIf we could grow more wheat under drought conditions, famers in dry climates could double the world\u2019s food supply.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatement of what is already known\n: Here you will try to give some information about what the consensus of facts are on this topic. Usually, you will mention other important papers which people trust as the current most reliable facts on the topic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYour contribution\n: Here you will try to show how your findings relate to the existing facts. Almost always there will also be current hypotheses, things that scientists believe are true but which we still don\u2019t fully understand or have enough evidence for.  Here you tell the reader what your paper adds. Perhaps you have found new evidence to support a hypothesis, or you have evidence that suggests the hypothesis is wrong.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample paper: \u201cPeople who like beach scenes are always in search of new photos because they are enjoyable and make great decorations for the living room. It generally accepted that beach photos reduce stress and lead to a happy home environment.  Previously, it has been suggested (Smith, 1993) that puzzle 124 (P-124) may ultimately be a beach scene. This hypothesis is also supported by the findings of Nash (1998, 2002) that assembled a beach ball in grid A2 of the puzzle. Lubbock 2017 contested the beach scene hypothesis when they claimed a section of grid A7 suggested a basketball, an item rarely if ever found in beach scenes. We have previously reported several seashell images in grid A6 (Greenwald 2018). Using new method for Computer-Automated-discovery of Marine Life (CAML), a software described in Black 2019 we now report a potential starfish (Asteroidea) in grid A7. The updated version of this software (CAML -STAR) could accelerate the detection of other Starfish and finally confirm the P-124 beach scene hypothesis.\n\n\nMethods\n\n\nAt some point, the paper will need to describe the work done to generate data. That data is then the basis for conclusions that are described later in the paper. Ideally the methods section will be detailed enough so that someone could replicate the work you have done. In some papers the methods themselves are not new. In that case this section could be as short as referring to another more detailed paper and describing that you followed that previously published method (perhaps you will describe any minor modifications). Other papers may have a longer methods section if they have created a new method.\n\n\nExample paper: A collection of 100 images which have been identified as coming from grid A7 were loaded into the CAML software (following the instructions detailed in Black 2019). However, we updated the original software to be more sensitive to the colors and textures more closely associated with known starfishes. Next, we used several known images to see if the CAML software could positively identify the known starfishes.  After making adjustments to the software code, we developed an analysis of all 100 grid A7 images. For each image the software generated a score (1-100) that estimated the likelihood that the image segment was of starfish origin (with 100 being an almost certain match). A link to the copy of this new software (CAML -STAR) is included in the supplemental materials.\n\n\nResults\n\n\nIn this section, you will present the data generated by your experiments. Here you will often have graphs and images (collectively known as \u201cfigures\u201d). These figures are often what your readers will care most about! This is because for readers that are familiar with your questions and the current research, the data are hopefully convincing enough that all of your other writing is just the \u201cicing on the cake.\u201d Here you will present your data with a minimal amount of interpretation. The figures themselves also need appropriate captions. These captions should explain what the figure shows and should have enough information that they stand on their own. There may also be statistical analyses in these sections. Using the mathematics of statistics there are a number of \u201cstatistical tests\u201d that we can run on data to help us determine if a result we obtain is likely to have happened by chance (accident) or if our data is very unlikely to have been observed purely by random chance.\n\n\nExample paper: In figure 1 we present image 62 of our puzzle piece collection along with an image of a known starfish. We show in figure 2 that CAML -STAR software is reliable because it was able to tell known-starfish images (positive control) from non-starfish images (negative control) with 99% accuracy. Figure 3 shows \u201cstarfish\u201d score for each of our 100 images. 98% of our images had a score of 95 or higher. This is a very unlikely result if our images did not come from starfish. The probability of these observations happening by random chance is less than 5% (p \n0.05, Chi-Squared statistical test).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion\n\n\nIn this section of the paper, your goal is to draw logical conclusions from the data presented to the questions and hypotheses you identified in the introduction. To do that, you need to think about what a reader who is familiar with the science might ask about the conclusions you pose. For example, if you are using a well-tested and reliable method, readers may not have many questions about the soundness of the method is (assuming you presented it in a detailed enough fashion). If your method is new, then much of your discussion and data need to support the method\u2019s reliability. If your conclusions fit neatly with existing hypotheses, your arguments may not need as much evidence than a case when your conclusions seek to overturn longstanding and accepted conclusions. Here you may also propose a new or modified hypothesis and suggest future work that can explore that new hypothesis. Remember, we don\u2019t irrefutably prove things in science, we present evidence that supports or rejects hypotheses and work to refine our hypotheses so that we can make more accurate predictions about phenomena and how they work.\n\n\nExample paper: In this study, we presented CAML-STAR a reliable new software that can identify starfishes with a low rate of error. [Many sentences explaining the figures and how the data support this conclusion]. When applied to images from grid A7 puzzle 124 we can conclude with a high degree of confidence that we have identified a starfish image in this grid. This work strongly supports the \u201cbeach scene\u201d hypothesis for puzzle 124. We anticipate future work may be able to make a species identification of the identified starfish and be used to identify other starfish in puzzle 124 and perhaps elsewhere.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nThroughout your paper, much of the knowledge presented will be from the work of previous investigations. It is important that when you present work that has been generated by others that you credit that work. Typically, a paper we will list the name/names of the researchers who published those papers and the year the work was published. You don\u2019t have to provide a reference for every fact (e.g., \u201cwater is wet\u201d), but accepted conclusions in the field will be noted. In the references section, you will present the list of authors, the title of the paper, and the journal and journal issue the work appeared in. The order of those items can vary according to where you publish. There is no writing or explanation here just a numbered list. It is also possible that references in the main text are only noted by superscript numbers (e.g., \u201cwe know that beach scene have a calming effect on the human mood1.\u201d)\n\n\nExample paper:\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n1. Smith, A.R., Scharf K. The calming effect of beach scenes on mood. Journal of Human Psychology, Vol 25. No.4, 2009\n\n\nSupplementary Materials\n\n\nSome papers will also have a supplemental section. This can contain many things including additional data and tables. In publication you normally have word and space limits and so this section may contain additional information of use to the reader.\n\n\n\n\nBacterial Transformation Mini Lab Writeup\n\n\nHow a lab writeup is different than a scientific paper\n\n\nWhile a lab writeup has a lot in common with a scientific paper, there are many differences. In general, a lab writeup is not presenting new and original research in an area of science. Instead, a lab writeup is a first step toward familiarizing you with the style and flow of scientific writing. A lab writeup helps to demonstrate that you are capturing the essential skills of documenting your work in the lab.\n\n\nAssignment\n\n\nFor this lab writeup, we will focus on the methods, results, and discussion of the bacterial transformation lab. Here are the instructions.\n\n\nTeam project\n\nThis writeup will be done as a group project amongst the groups who worked on the lab in class.\n\n\nSections and length\n\nYou will be responsible for only three sections described as follows. The length of the assignment should not be more than three pages. You may as a group decide to split the work so that each person is responsible for one (or a part) of a section. Be sure the completed work meets everyone\u2019s approval.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethods\n: In this section, you should provide a detailed, step-by-step description of the work done in the laboratory. Since you were presented with a method in class you can use this as a starting point, but for each step you must a) note if you modified a step in any way; 2) provide a simple explanation for the purpose of each step. Say what you did, but do not draw conclusions in this section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults\n: In this section, you should present image(s) of the final bacterial plates. You should describe what is seen on each plate (e.g., a lawn of growing bacteria, no bacterial growth, bacteria colonies). You may have photos in white and UV light. Describe each photo and what the person viewing should notice. Make it clear which plates have what antibiotics and which plates had bacteria with or without plasmid. Say what you see, but do not draw conclusions in this section.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion\n: In this section, you should present the purpose of the experiment, describing the intention to transform bacteria with the pGFP plasmid. You should explain what the purpose of each plate (with their combinations of plasmid/antibiotics/LB) was. Indicate if the predictions (hypothesis) matched the results you obtained.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPaper Due Date and Return\n\n\nPlease write your paper as a Google doc. This is due by 10PM on January 20th, 2021. Ensure your paper has the names of all students submitting involved. Email Mr. Williams when your paper is ready.",

For example, if we asked a school to figure out how cars work (no Wikipedia or Google), we might investigate how engines work, how transmissions work, how gasoline works, how wheels work, etc. There is one big question (how cars work) but the way to answer that is usually by figuring out how individual components work and trying to put that knowledge together. This approach is called reductionism (reducing a large problem to the sum of its parts). It is not the only approach, and does not always work, but that is another conversation.  When you write your paper, you are announcing you have found a new and important puzzle piece! But there are problems. Scientific questions usually come from a really big puzzle. Suppose in your section of the puzzle you have found a starfish. Maybe the puzzle is a beach scene? But what if someone else\u2019s puzzle pieces are shaping into a snowy mountain? They might not believe you are interpreting things correctly. You may think the same - maybe their section will turn out to be a cloud? You will not only need to put some context to your work (i.e., we have other pieces that look like sand and water), but you will need to prove you are qualified to tell what starfishes look like (i.e., you have a marine biology degree). You will need to show you are both working on the same puzzle and your pieces belong to the same image. Before we get too lost in analogy, let\u2019s come back to the main sections of a paper and see what they do for us.",

This hypothesis is also supported by the findings of Nash (1998, 2002) that assembled a beach ball in grid A2 of the puzzle. Lubbock 2017 contested the beach scene hypothesis when they claimed a section of grid A7 suggested a basketball, an item rarely if ever found in beach scenes. We have previously reported several seashell images in grid A6 (Greenwald 2018). Using new method for Computer-Automated-discovery of Marine Life (CAML), a software described in Black 2019 we now report a potential starfish (Asteroidea) in grid A7. The updated version of this software (CAML -STAR) could accelerate the detection of other Starfish and finally confirm the P-124 beach scene hypothesis."

There are\n   usually two types of entries:    Lab demos: Are demonstrations of techniques. You will take notes but not\n not necessarily do the experiment yourself.    Labs: These are full labs where you and lab partners will preform the\n experiment.      In many cases you will be provided a protocol for the lab. You should still\n   copy the protocol into your notebook with annotations as to what you\n   observed and notes if the protocol is modified in any way.    Photos, sketches, and any other records or results should be entered in your\n   notebook.",

Remove the disc from the extract using a sterile tweezer or pipette tip and transfer the disc into the fresh tube containing wash buffer. Tap or flick the tube to mix for 5 seconds, then allow the disc to sit in the wash buffer for 1 minute.    Use a sterile pipette tip to gently drag the disc out of the wash buffer and up the tube wall to dry at the top of the tube. Ensure that little to no debris is attached to the disk. Allow the disc to air dry for 2 minutes to evaporate the ethanol on the disc.    While the disc is air-drying, add 30 \u00b5L of TE to a clean 1.5-mL tube labeled with the sample identification number.    Once dry, carefully transfer the disc using a sterile tweezer or pipette tip into the fresh tube containing 30 \u00b5L of TE. Allow the disc to soak for a minimum of 15 minutes at ambient temperature (soaking the disc overnight at 4\u00b0 C is optimal) to elute the purified DNA    The disc in TE can be stored at 4\u00b0 C temporarily or frozen at -20\u00b0 C for long-term storage until ready to begin Part III; ensure that the disc has incubated at ambient temperature for at least 15 minutes before storage at 4\u00b0 C or -20\u00b0 C.    PCR    Obtain PCR tube containing Ready-To-Go PCR Bead containing dehydrated Taq polymerase, nucleotides, and buffer. Label the tube with your identification number.    Use a micropipette with a fresh tip to add 23 \u00b5L of the appropriate primer/loading dye mix to each tube (refer to primer table below). Allow the beads to dissolve for 1 minute at ambient temperature.    Place the PCR tubes on ice to prevent premature replication of unwanted primer dimers.    Use a micropipette with fresh tip to add 2 \u00b5L of your DNA (from Part II) directly into PCR tube with primer and polymerase mixture. Ensure that no DNA remains in the tip after pipetting.    Store your sample on ice until your class is ready to begin thermal cycling.    Place your PCR tube, along with those of the other students, in a thermal cycler that has been programmed with the appropriate PCR protocol.",

We have performed this procedure countless times, for example when we add some sugar to a cup of hot tea. To find the concentration, we need to know how much solvent (usually in grams) is dissolved in how much solvent (usually measured in liters).\n\n\nDilution of stock solutions\n\n\nCommonly, we will create high-concentration solutions in the lab that can later be diluted. A high-concentration solution is called a 'stock' solution. Making a stock solution allows us to save space. For example, if we have a solution that has 100g of salt in 1L of water, we need a liter-sized bottle to store it. However, if we dissolve 100g of salt in 0.1L of water, we can store the same amount of solution in 1/10th the space.\n\n\nQuestion How does using a stock solution (vs. making a new solution every time it is needed) make science more reproducible?\n\n\nTo dilute a solution from the original concentration to a new concentration we need to keep track of several things:\n\n\n\n\nThe original concentration of the solution\n\n\nThe desired final amount (volume) of the dilution we are making\n\n\nDesired final concentration of the dilution we are making\n\n\n\n\nThe thing we need to figure out is what amount (volume) of the concentrated stock solution do we need to add to more solvent to make a more dilute solution.\n\n\nAgain, keep in mind that this is an 'everyday' problem. Imagine you made some soup and accidentally added too much salt. You can't take the salt out, but you can add more water to make the final concentration of the salt less.\n\n\nThe formula for calculating dilutions is:\n\n\nC\n1\nV\n1\n = C\n2\nV\n2\n\n\nWhere:\n\n\n\n\nC\n1\n = The original/starting concentration of the stock solution\n\n\nV\n1\n = The (unknown) amount (volume) of the stock solution you will\n  need to use\n\n\nC\n2\n = The final, desired concentration\n\n\nV\n2\n = The final, desired volume you wish to make\n\n\n\n\nMoles\n\n\nProbably one of the most important concepts in chemistry is the concept of a mole). The mole is a special number (it even has its own holiday). A mole is just a number, but a very large one:\n\n\n6.02214078\u00d710\n23\n (A mole: also known as, Avagadro's Number)\n\n\nA 'mole' is actually shorthand for that large number. Just like a 'dozen' = 12, a couple = 2, etc.\n\n\nSo why do we need this number?\n\n\nWell, Atoms are very small. We can't count them one by one, but when we have lots of atoms (several grams at least for the kinds of scales we have at school), we can measure and estimate how many atoms we have.\n\n\nWeighing atoms\n\n\nBy definition, when we have a mole of atoms, we have 6.02214078\u00d710\n23\n atoms. In reality, just like not every egg will weigh 73g, different atoms have a diffent atomic mass. On the periodic table, the atomic mass is the number below the element symbol:\nFor carbon (C), 12.011g of carbon, we have 6.02214078\u00d710\n23\n carbon atoms. A 1.008g sample of hydrogen (H) weighs much less but has the same number of atoms.\nWhy this is very important\n\n\nWith an understanding of Avagradro's number and the atomic masses from the periodic table, we can accomplish something amazing. When we combine elements to form a new compound (e.g. combining hydrogen and oxygen to make water), we know exactly how much (mass) of hydrogen we need to combine with how much oxygen so that we have enough amounts of each.\n\n\nMolar mass/moluar mass/fomula weight\n\n\nWhen we have a compound such as Glucose (C\n6\nH\n12\nO\n6\n) we calculate the molar mass as the sum of the total number of moles of each atom in the compound.\n\n\nC\n6\nH\n12\nO\n6\n\n\n6 Moles of Carbon 12 Moles of Hydrogen 6 Moles of Oxygen\n\n\nMolarity\n\n\nRelated to moles is the concept of molarity, or how many moles of a substance do we have in a solution. The formula for molarity of is:\n\n\nMoles of solute/ Liters of solvent\n\n\nLimiting reagents\n\n\nConceptually, knowing how many moles we have allows us to determine in advance how many moles of a substance is needed to create a particular molecule. For example: C\n6\nH\n12\nO\n6\n Would require us to have 6 moles of Carbon, 6 moles of Oxygen, and 12 moles of Hydrogen\n\n\nWhile we won't solve an example here, the sandwich example below gets the point across about limiting reagents - we can only make a much of a substance as the least abundant component will allow; If we have hundreds of slices of cheese, but only 2 slices of bread, we get only one sandwich.\n\n\nLinks\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a mole\n - A nice intro to the mole.\n\n\nDilution Problems, Chemistry, Molarity \n Concentration Examples, Formula \n Equations\n - Although some slightly different notation is used, this is a thorough intro to dilutions.",

Molecular biology for us largely deals with understanding the life through the lens of its chemical components, mainly DNA. There is much more to life than DNA, but life as we know it largely depends on this (and other) nucleic acids. We will cover the basics and get our first introduction to the technologies and approaches that unlock this special molecule.",

            "text": "Method\n\n\nWhat do you know?\n\n\nHere are some questions to answer before reading further\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a \"method\"? What are some examples you can think of?\n\n\nWhat makes something \"scientific\"?\n\n\nWhat is the scientific method?\n\n\n\n\nConcept\n\n\n01 - Methods are an approach to predictable results\n\n\nThis may not sound particularly insightful, but starting from this general\nconcept, we will explore it for now in a very specific context.\n\n\nLet's start with a tentative definition for the scientific method:\n\n\nThe \nScientific Method\n is the idea that \nquestions about the natural\n world\ncan by answered by \nfollowing some set of steps\n to \nacquire knowledge\n\nand \nexplain that knowledge\n in the form of a \nhypothesis\n.\n\n\nPhilosophy and inquiry\n\n\nWhen we ask \"what something is?\" we are immediately in the realm of philosophy.\nPhilosophy is a deep and wonderful area of human knowledge. It is \nnot\n science,\nbut for centuries it has explored important questions scientists would do well not to ignore\n\n\nPhilosophy does\n\n\nConcept Clarification\n: One of the tasks of philosophy is to clarify what\nwe mean when we say something. Take the phrase \"it's a beautiful day.\" What is\nbeauty? What is the day? Philosophy is nearly endless in its pursuit of\nquestions, and questions of the form \"what is X?\" lead to entire fields of\nphilosophical study (e.g. \"what is beauty\" is the subject of aesthetics; \"what\nis a part and what is a whole?\" is the subject of mereology).\n\n\nPhilosophy tries to help us be clear about words and their meaning, and what\nwe mean when we use those words.\n\n\nTo get quickly to the practical, how do we benefit from the work philosophy\ndoes? Here are four questions philosophy has worked on and that we can learn\nfrom:\n\n\nPhilosophy asks\n\n\nWhat is knowledge?\n\n\nEpistemology\n- \u03b5\u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1\n*\n\nis a branch of philosophy that asks the question how can we know something?\nWhat is evidence for/against something? How and when should we trust (or refuse\nto trust) evidence? When do we have enough evidence? These are very important\nquestions in the sciences.\n\n\nWhat is logical?\n\n\nLogic - \u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\n is a branch of philosophy\nwhich asks about what are the rules of reason and reasoning. Given some premise\n(e.g. Socrates is a man, men are mortal) how do we reach a conclusion (e.g.\nSocrates is a man, therefore he is mortal) that is true? Logic also gives rise\nto mathematics which underlies the natural sciences (although math is \nnot\n a\nscience).\n\n\nHow do we communicate our meaning?\n\n\nPhilosophy of language\n\nasks how do we use words (or signs; see semantics \n\u03c3\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2\n) to represent abstract concepts? In the\nEnglish language for example, I can \"\nknow\n that I have 3 dollars in my\npocket\" and I can \"\nknow\n how my friend thinks.\" Spanish, like other Romance\nlanguages distinguishes between knowing a fact (verb: saber) from knowing\nsomeone you have relationship with (verb: conocer).\n\n\nUltimately, to operate in science we need to weigh evidence, develop logical\nconclusions, and express our meaning. These approaches are not inherently\nscientific, but they are used by science.\n\nPhilosophy of science\n is\nconcerned with a more thorough exploration of what the role of philosophy is in\nthe sciences.\n\n\n\n\nTake home message\n: Science makes use of philosophical tools (methods) to do\nits work. At some point, you should get to know a bit about that subject.\n\n\n\n\n*\nNote\n: Although here and in many cases philosophy makes use of\nGreek terms this is not meant to privilege Greek or Western thought. Every\nhuman culture has its own ways of thinking and reasoning and it is arrogant to\nsuggest that the most popular (or best documented) approach is necessarily the\nbest one. It is also arrogant to imagine that Greek philosophy did not have its\nantecedents in other cultures. The use of the Greek terms above is to draw\nattention both to the important contributions of the Greek scholars and to\nacknowledge that if we ignore their specific origin we risk imagining that these\nare the only possible ways to think about these terms.\n\n\nKey questions\n\n\nAfter that detour through philosophy, how do we bring those ideas back to\nscience? Well, to do science we need to have a working definition so let's\nreturn to the one suggested above:\n\n\n\n\nThe \nScientific Method\n is the idea that \nquestions about the natural\n world\ncan by answered by \nfollowing some set of steps\n to \nacquire knowledge\n\nabout the world and \nexplain that knowledge\n in the form of a \nhypothesis\n.\n\n\n\n\nUsing this definition, and the one you posed in the \nWhat do you know\n\nquestions, here are some additional ones to ask.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes the scientific method resemble how we ask questions about the world in\n   in ways that aren't traditionally considered science? For example, is a\n   criminal investigation scientific? Is the exploration of a theme in the\n   Beethoven's Diabelli variations (Op. 120) scientific? Is a model volcano\n   presented at a science fair scientific?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the \"natural world\"?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBesides the scientific method, what other methods do you think we might see\n   used in science?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActivity\n\n\nShort essay\n\n\n\n\nAbout short essay assignments\n\n\nShort essay assignments are typed, 500 words maximum or less. In addition to\n  getting to know your thoughts they are also a chance to get feedback on\n  your writing. You will usually have a minimum of two weeks to complete these\n  assignments. It is highly suggested that you give yourself time to write a\n  first draft, reflect and/or get feedback, and write a final draft.\n\n\n\n\nWrite a short essay on the following topic:\n\n\nThe scientific method is a unique form of inquiry\n\n\nThe point of your essay can be to support or refute the above statement; it's\nyour choice which position to support.\n\n\nThink about breaking up this essay into 3 sections\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction to the scientific method\n\n\nA body where you contrast the scientific method with one or more other forms\n  of inquiry (for example, how does the scientific method compare to how a\n  fiction author explores a character in a novel).\n\n\nA conclusion where you summarize your thoughts\n\n\n\n\nThis is something more of an English assignment rather than a scientific writing\nassignment. You may have any opinion or position you want, but develop your\nideas clearly and keep your writing simple.\n\n\nReadings and resources\n\n\nThere are a number of books, articles, links, etc. that could contribute to this\ntopic. These resources are not meant to be exhaustive or suggest you should\nreview all of these materials. If this topic piques your curiosity, have a look.\nPlease also suggest other resources that you find and I will add to this list.\nYou will \nnot\n need to purchase or read these books to complete any\nassignment. These are meant for your own enrichment. \n\n\nBooks\n\n\nWhat Is This Thing Called Science?\n - Alan F. Chalmers\n\n\n\n\nAmazon link\n\n\nAmazon Summary: Since its first publication in 1976, Alan Chalmers's highly\n  regarded and widely read work--translated into eighteen languages--has become\n  a classic introduction to the scientific method, known for its accessibility\n  to beginners and its value as a resource for advanced students and scholars.\n\n\n\n\nDefending Science - within reason\n - Susan Haack\n\n\n\n\nAmazon link\n\n\nAmazon Summary: Sweeping in scope, penetrating in analysis, and generously\n  illustrated with examples from the history of science, this new and original\n  approach to familiar questions about scientific evidence and method tackles\n  vital questions about science and its place in society. Avoiding the twin\n  pitfalls of scientism and cynicism, noted philosopher Susan Haack argues that,\n  fallible and flawed as they are, the natural sciences have been among the most\n  successful of human enterprises-valuable not only for the vast, interlocking\n  body of knowledge they have discovered, and not only for the technological\n  advances that have improved our lives, but as a manifestation of the human\n  talent for inquiry at its imperfect but sometimes remarkable best. This\n  wide-ranging, trenchant, and illuminating book explores the complexities of\n  scientific evidence, and the multifarious ways in which the sciences have\n  refined and amplified the methods of everyday empirical inquiry; articulates\n  the ways in which the social sciences are like the natural sciences, and the\n  ways in which they are different; disentangles the confusions of radical\n  rhetoricians and cynical sociologists of science; exposes the evasions of\n  apologists for religious resistance to scientific advances; weighs the\n  benefits and the dangers of technology; tracks the efforts of the legal system\n  to make the best use of scientific testimony; and tackles predictions of the\n  eventual culmination, or annihilation, of the scientific enterprise.Writing\n  with verve and wry humor, in a witty, direct, and accessible style, Haack\n  takes readers beyond the \"Science Wars\" to a balanced understanding of the\n  value, and the limitations, of the scientific enterprise.",

What is the day? Philosophy is nearly endless in its pursuit of\nquestions, and questions of the form \"what is X?\" lead to entire fields of\nphilosophical study (e.g. \"what is beauty\" is the subject of aesthetics; \"what\nis a part and what is a whole?\" is the subject of mereology).  Philosophy tries to help us be clear about words and their meaning, and what\nwe mean when we use those words.  To get quickly to the practical, how do we benefit from the work philosophy\ndoes?

How and when should we trust (or refuse\nto trust) evidence? When do we have enough evidence? These are very important\nquestions in the sciences.  What is logical?  Logic - \u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae  is a branch of philosophy\nwhich asks about what are the rules of reason and reasoning. Given some premise\n(e.g. Socrates is a man, men are mortal) how do we reach a conclusion (e.g.\nSocrates is a man, therefore he is mortal) that is true? Logic also gives rise\nto mathematics which underlies the natural sciences (although math is  not  a\nscience).  How do we communicate our meaning?  Philosophy of language \nasks how do we use words (or signs; see semantics  \u03c3\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 ) to represent abstract concepts? In the\nEnglish language for example, I can \" know  that I have 3 dollars in my\npocket\" and I can \" know  how my friend thinks.\" Spanish, like other Romance\nlanguages distinguishes between knowing a fact (verb: saber) from knowing\nsomeone you have relationship with (verb: conocer).  Ultimately, to operate in science we need to weigh evidence, develop logical\nconclusions, and express our meaning. These approaches are not inherently\nscientific, but they are used by science. Philosophy of science  is\nconcerned with a more thorough exploration of what the role of philosophy is in\nthe sciences.   Take home message : Science makes use of philosophical tools (methods) to do\nits work. At some point, you should get to know a bit about that subject.   * Note : Although here and in many cases philosophy makes use of\nGreek terms this is not meant to privilege Greek or Western thought. Every\nhuman culture has its own ways of thinking and reasoning and it is arrogant to\nsuggest that the most popular (or best documented) approach is necessarily the\nbest one. It is also arrogant to imagine that Greek philosophy did not have its\nantecedents in other cultures. The use of the Greek terms above is to draw\nattention both to the important contributions of the Greek scholars and to\nacknowledge that if we ignore their specific origin we risk imagining that these\nare the only possible ways to think about these terms.",

Well, to do science we need to have a working definition so let's\nreturn to the one suggested above:   The  Scientific Method  is the idea that  questions about the natural  world\ncan by answered by  following some set of steps  to  acquire knowledge \nabout the world and  explain that knowledge  in the form of a  hypothesis .   Using this definition, and the one you posed in the  What do you know \nquestions, here are some additional ones to ask.    Does the scientific method resemble how we ask questions about the world in\n   in ways that aren't traditionally considered science? For example, is a\n   criminal investigation scientific? Is the exploration of a theme in the\n   Beethoven's Diabelli variations (Op. 120) scientific? Is a model volcano\n   presented at a science fair scientific?    What is the \"natural world\"?

Chalmers   Amazon link  Amazon Summary: Since its first publication in 1976, Alan Chalmers's highly\n  regarded and widely read work--translated into eighteen languages--has become\n  a classic introduction to the scientific method, known for its accessibility\n  to beginners and its value as a resource for advanced students and scholars.   Defending Science - within reason  - Susan Haack   Amazon link  Amazon Summary: Sweeping in scope, penetrating in analysis, and generously\n  illustrated with examples from the history of science, this new and original\n  approach to familiar questions about scientific evidence and method tackles\n  vital questions about science and its place in society. Avoiding the twin\n  pitfalls of scientism and cynicism, noted philosopher Susan Haack argues that,\n  fallible and flawed as they are, the natural sciences have been among the most\n  successful of human enterprises-valuable not only for the vast, interlocking\n  body of knowledge they have discovered, and not only for the technological\n  advances that have improved our lives, but as a manifestation of the human\n  talent for inquiry at its imperfect but sometimes remarkable best. This\n  wide-ranging, trenchant, and illuminating book explores the complexities of\n  scientific evidence, and the multifarious ways in which the sciences have\n  refined and amplified the methods of everyday empirical inquiry; articulates\n  the ways in which the social sciences are like the natural sciences, and the\n  ways in which they are different; disentangles the confusions of radical\n  rhetoricians and cynical sociologists of science; exposes the evasions of\n  apologists for religious resistance to scientific advances; weighs the\n  benefits and the dangers of technology; tracks the efforts of the legal system\n  to make the best use of scientific testimony; and tackles predictions of the\n  eventual culmination, or annihilation, of the scientific enterprise.Writing\n  with verve and wry humor, in a witty, direct, and accessible style, Haack\n  takes readers beyond the \"Science Wars\" to a balanced understanding of the\n  value, and the limitations, of the scientific enterprise.",
