<h2 id="scientists-are-writers">Scientists are writers</h2>
<p>Writing is the one thing you will never see a scientist doing on film or TV.<br />
In reality, the more senior a scientist you are the less time you spend doing
experiments and the more time you spend writing.</p>
<p>Why is writing essential for scientists? Your entire career depends upon:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your ability to clearly communicate your research results</li>
<li>Your ability to convince prospective employers your work is important</li>
<li>Your ability to convince those who fund your work (sometimes your employer,
  but more often government agencies and philanthropic foundations) that they should pay for your work to be done</li>
</ul>
<p>There are other reasons to be a good writer, but if you fail in the three areas above, your career will end before it starts.</p>
<h2 id="youve-been-mislead">You've been mislead</h2>
<p>In your life as a student, you have almost certainly been mislead
about writing. This has not been done purposely but as a symptom of standard
education. By high school you have already done a fair amount of writing. By
college graduation you may have written more essays than you will ever do later
in life (unless you become a writer, or a scientist). Where does deception fit
in?</p>
<p>For most of your life as a writer, people (your teachers) have been paid to
read your writing.</p>
<p>That circumstance is opposite of how the real world works - unless you
become a novelist and are successful enough that people pay you to read your
writing.</p>
<p>Your beautiful lab reports, flowing essays, and personal stories are usually
read by people who's job depends on reading your work (see the video on the
craft of writing effectively to which I credit this insight). The problem with
this circumstance is that that even if your writing is not very good, your
teachers will still read it and if you are fortunate give you useful help. What about this situation makes you a victim?</p>
<p>When people are judging you by your writing, and when they have the option of
not reading your writing they are in a far different position than your
teachers.</p>
<p><strong>If your writing is confusing, redundant, hard to follow, etc. your readers will simply stop reading</strong></p>
<p>This is devastating if your reader is a college admission officer, an employer, or a science funding agency.</p>
<p>Fortunately, writing is a skill, and like all skills it can be learned and
improved by practice. There is no shame if your writing skills are poor at the
moment.</p>
<p>Simply put, scientists need to be good writers to succeed and if you want to be a scientist, you will need to be a good writer. Even if you don't plan on being a scientist, this advice will benefit you.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-become-a-good-writer">How to become a good writer</h2>
<p>The best advice here, is that the more you write, read other's writing, and
(importantly) edit writing, the more natural good writing will become. This is
a long-term project and it is never too late to begin.   </p>
<p>I'll admit up front that this article cannot make you into a good writer. While
you still need to get to that destination, no single step will take you there.
Instead, I have assembled a few resources to help. I have also taken a
perspective, one taken by the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Longman-Guide-Revising-Prose-Turning/dp/0321417666">The Longman Guide to Revising Prose</a> - we will
focus on good editing skills rather than writing.</p>
<h2 id="why-focus-on-editing">Why focus on editing?</h2>
<p>Why focus on editing writing? I offer two quotes (I hope I have the sources correct, but the ideas are valid)</p>
<ul>
<li>"All writing is rewriting" - John Green, Author</li>
<li>"I would have written a shorter letter, but I did not have the time."
   Blaise Pascal, Philosopher/Mathematician</li>
</ul>
<p>You are smart, creative, and original. But like most human beings, it's more
than likely that what you first write on the page is not the clearest
expression of what you want to communicate.</p>
<p>It is said that we often judge ourselves by our intentions and others by their
actions. What that aphorism means and what I am alluding to about writing is
that we usually know what we mean to say when we write something down. What we
usually find out is that our readers may interpret our words differently.</p>
<p>Although this sounds like a recipe for frustration, there are some easy ways
to overcome most of the problems caused by this dilemma. The easiest and first
solution is to <strong>put distance between yourself and your writing.</strong></p>
<p>Have you ever read something you wrote a few days or weeks ago and found things
that were unclear or errors of some sort? By reading your writing after some
time has past, you become a more objective reader, and can often find and fix
mistakes. This is the best argument for making sure that for writing
assignments you give yourself time. <strong>Rushed, last-minute writing will almost
certainly cost you.</strong></p>
<p>As you become a better writer you will also become a better editor of your own
writing. The next thing suggestion for editing is to <strong>follow a method</strong>. The
method suggested below will not correct every type of writing difficulty, but provides clear guidelines for revising writing.</p>
<h3 id="paramedic-method">Paramedic Method</h3>
<p>Below are a handout and video that explain this method (which is explained in
detail in the above Longman Guide book). I will not ask you memorize or demand
that you always use this method. I do hope that if you take a little time to understand it, you will apply in revision assignment below.</p>
<p>This method has a few versions and I'll list a few steps at its core:</p>
<ol>
<li>Circle/highlight prepositions (of, in, to) - You will be looking to reduce or eliminate</li>
<li>Circle the "is" forms of verbs (where possible you will want to eliminate the verb to be)</li>
<li>Circle the action (you will want to replace "is/to be" verbs with action verbs)</li>
<li>Simplify actions and avoid compound verbs</li>
<li>Start sentences fast - get to the point and avoid filler</li>
<li>Read the writing aloud with feeling and correct sentences that sound awkward</li>
</ol>
<p>These 6 rules may sound a bit intimidating, but as I said you don't have to memorize them. Instead, watch this video that explains how this method works:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/I-giy45vIwM">The Paramedic Method</a>  [17 minutes]</li>
<li><a href="https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/subject_specific_writing/writing_in_engineering/indot_workshop_resources_for_engineers/documents/20080306044511_727.pdf">Paramedic method handout - this is unrelated to the specific video but has some nice examples</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This method is a first step to writing clear sentences. Besides clear sentence
structure you must think about how you develop logical arguments and how your
voice makes it easy for the reader to understand your meaning.</p>
<p>The final step of improving writing is to actually have someone else read your
writing. A good editor should return to you a document covered in red
ink. Your assignment is not to have an ego about this or get upset. Instead,
you should be grateful for anyone who gives a critical assessment and strive to
use their suggestions to improve your result. Never take editing personally.
Even the most skilled writers will always face the editor's pen.</p>
<h2 id="one-more-piece-of-advice">One more piece of advice</h2>
<p>Here are some rules by Orson Wells on writing well. They've stood the test of
time:</p>
<ol>
<li>Never use a metaphor, simile, or other figure of speech which you are used
   to seeing in print. (i.e avoid cliche)</li>
<li>Never use a long word where a short one will do.</li>
<li>If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.</li>
<li>Never use the passive where you can use the active.</li>
<li>Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word, or a jargon word if you can
   think of an everyday English equivalent. (This rule will bend for science writing)</li>
<li>Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="assignment">Assignment</h2>
<p>You were asked to write a short essay about the scientific method. Now you will
be sharing that essay with a classmate. You will need to pair with one
classmate and agree to edit their work. If there is an odd number, a group of
three can be formed.</p>
<p>Here is what to do depending on weather you are the author or the reviewer:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Step</th>
<th>Author</th>
<th>Reviewer</th>

</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>Share your document with reviewer via. Google docs</td>
<td></td>

You may want to ask specific questions of the author; 2) suggest changes or rewordings that you think would help <li> When you have completed your review, let the author know you are done.</ul></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td><ul><li> On a new page in the same document, rewrite the essay; <strong>DO NOT ACCEPT CHANGES SUGGESTED BY THE REVIEWER</strong> leave those so that I can see the review work that has been done <li>In your new version, attempt to apply the paramedic method to improve your sentences</ul></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>
